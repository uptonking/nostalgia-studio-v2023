/**
 * Graph event handler that creates new connections. Uses {@link TerminalMarker}
 * for finding and highlighting the source and target vertices and
 * <factoryMethod> to create the edge instance. This handler is built-into
 * {@link Graph#connectionHandler} and enabled using {@link Graph#setConnectable}.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * new mxConnectionHandler(graph, (source, target, style)=>
 * {
 *   edge = new mxCell('', new mxGeometry());
 *   edge.setEdge(true);
 *   edge.setStyle(style);
 *   edge.geometry.relative = true;
 *   return edge;
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Here is an alternative solution that just sets a specific user object for
 * new edges by overriding <insertEdge>.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * mxConnectionHandlerInsertEdge = insertEdge;
 * insertEdge = (parent, id, value, source, target, style)=>
 * {
 *   value = 'Test';
 *
 *   return mxConnectionHandlerInsertEdge.apply(this, arguments);
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * Using images to trigger connections:
 *
 * This handler uses mxTerminalMarker to find the source and target cell for
 * the new connection and creates a new edge using <connect>. The new edge is
 * created using <createEdge> which in turn uses <factoryMethod> or creates a
 * new default edge.
 *
 * The handler uses a "highlight-paradigm" for indicating if a cell is being
 * used as a source or target terminal, as seen in other diagramming products.
 * In order to allow both, moving and connecting cells at the same time,
 * {@link Constants#DEFAULT_HOTSPOT} is used in the handler to determine the hotspot
 * of a cell, that is, the region of the cell which is used to trigger a new
 * connection. The constant is a value between 0 and 1 that specifies the
 * amount of the width and height around the center to be used for the hotspot
 * of a cell and its default value is 0.5. In addition,
 * {@link Constants#MIN_HOTSPOT_SIZE} defines the minimum number of pixels for the
 * width and height of the hotspot.
 *
 * This solution, while standards compliant, may be somewhat confusing because
 * there is no visual indicator for the hotspot and the highlight is seen to
 * switch on and off while the mouse is being moved in and out. Furthermore,
 * this paradigm does not allow to create different connections depending on
 * the highlighted hotspot as there is only one hotspot per cell and it
 * normally does not allow cells to be moved and connected at the same time as
 * there is no clear indication of the connectable area of the cell.
 *
 * To come across these issues, the handle has an additional <createIcons> hook
 * with a default implementation that allows to create one icon to be used to
 * trigger new connections. If this icon is specified, then new connections can
 * only be created if the image is clicked while the cell is being highlighted.
 * The <createIcons> hook may be overridden to create more than one
 * {@link ImageShape} for creating new connections, but the default implementation
 * supports one image and is used as follows:
 *
 * In order to display the "connect image" whenever the mouse is over the cell,
 * an DEFAULT_HOTSPOT of 1 should be used:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * mxConstants.DEFAULT_HOTSPOT = 1;
 * ```
 *
 * In order to avoid confusion with the highlighting, the highlight color
 * should not be used with a connect image:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * mxConstants.HIGHLIGHT_COLOR = null;
 * ```
 *
 * To install the image, the connectImage field of the mxConnectionHandler must
 * be assigned a new {@link Image} instance:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * connectImage = new mxImage('images/green-dot.gif', 14, 14);
 * ```
 *
 * This will use the green-dot.gif with a width and height of 14 pixels as the
 * image to trigger new connections. In createIcons the icon field of the
 * handler will be set in order to remember the icon that has been clicked for
 * creating the new connection. This field will be available under selectedIcon
 * in the connect method, which may be overridden to take the icon that
 * triggered the new connection into account. This is useful if more than one
 * icon may be used to create a connection.
 *
 * Group: Events
 *
 * Event: mxEvent.START
 *
 * Fires when a new connection is being created by the user. The <code>state</code>
 * property contains the state of the source cell.
 *
 * Event: mxEvent.CONNECT
 *
 * Fires between begin- and endUpdate in <connect>. The <code>cell</code>
 * property contains the inserted edge, the <code>event</code> and <code>target</code>
 * properties contain the respective arguments that were passed to <connect> (where
 * target corresponds to the dropTarget argument). Finally, the <code>terminal</code>
 * property corresponds to the target argument in <connect> or the clone of the source
 * terminal if <createTarget> is enabled.
 *
 * Note that the target is the cell under the mouse where the mouse button was released.
 * Depending on the logic in the handler, this doesn't necessarily have to be the target
 * of the inserted edge. To print the source, target or any optional ports IDs that the
 * edge is connected to, the following code can be used. To get more details about the
 * actual connection point, {@link Graph#getConnectionConstraint} can be used. To resolve
 * the port IDs, use <Transactions.getCell>.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * graph.getPlugin('ConnectionHandler').addListener(mxEvent.CONNECT, (sender, evt)=>
 * {
 *   let edge = evt.getProperty('cell');
 *   let source = graph.getDataModel().getTerminal(edge, true);
 *   let target = graph.getDataModel().getTerminal(edge, false);
 *
 *   let style = graph.getCellStyle(edge);
 *   let sourcePortId = style[mxConstants.STYLE_SOURCE_PORT];
 *   let targetPortId = style[mxConstants.STYLE_TARGET_PORT];
 *
 *   MaxLog.show();
 *   MaxLog.debug('connect', edge, source.id, target.id, sourcePortId, targetPortId);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Event: mxEvent.RESET
 *
 * Fires when the <reset> method is invoked.
 *
 * Constructor: mxConnectionHandler
 *
 * Constructs an event handler that connects vertices using the specified
 * factory method to create the new edges. Modify
 * {@link Constants#ACTIVE_REGION} to setup the region on a cell which triggers
 * the creation of a new connection or use connect icons as explained
 * above.
 *
 * @param graph Reference to the enclosing {@link Graph}.
 * @param factoryMethod Optional function to create the edge. The function takes
 * the source and target <Cell> as the first and second argument and an
 * optional cell style from the preview as the third argument. It returns
 * the <Cell> that represents the new edge.
